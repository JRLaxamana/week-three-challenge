# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

The web is a vast place with many eyes on it at any given moment. Many companies work within the world wide web, utilizing systems with many users. Be it a website as simple as Facebook, a work email, or highly sensitive information; you want that login secured by a strong password. Unfortunately, many users fall into the trap of using the same password across multiple sites and systems. In order to combat this, I've created a password generator that creates a strong password with a simple click.

## Usage

* When first opening the page, the user is presented with several prompts to accept or deny.

-A desired length between 8 and 128 characters.

-To confirm or deny wanting lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and or special characters generated in the password.

* User clicks the "Generate Password" Button 

* Should all prompts be answered, a password will be generated with the appropriate user inputed choices.

* The password is displayed on the page.
